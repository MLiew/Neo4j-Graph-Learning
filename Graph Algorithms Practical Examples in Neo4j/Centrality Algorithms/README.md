# Centrality Algorithms
The centrality algorithms used in the mini social network example are as the following: 
1. **Degree centrality**: Measures the number of relationships a node has.
2. **Closeness centrality**: Calculates which nodes have the shortest paths to all other nodes.
3. **Betweeness centrality**: Measures the number of shortest paths that pass through a node.
4. **Page rank**: Estimates a current node's importance from its linked neighbors and their neighbors.
